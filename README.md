# My Resume with React PDF ðŸ“‘

I've used [Enhancv](https://enhancv.com) to build my resumes ðŸ¥° ([see my enhancv doc](./docs/by-enhancv.pdf)), it's an awesome tool, really easy to use. But, in order to save some money ðŸ’¸, I decided to build my own resume. ðŸ’¯

### Objetives

- [x] Use [ReactPDF](https://react-pdf.org/) to build the document.
- [x] Use my beautiful Enhancv theme as inspiration.
- [ ] Support internationalization.
- [ ] Support dynamic content from external service.
